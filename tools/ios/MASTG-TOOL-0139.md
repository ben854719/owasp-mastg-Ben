ElleKit is a function-hooking framework used by the popular jailbreaks Dopamine and palera1n. It provides an API for both Substrate and libhooker.

Tweaks installed via @MASTG-TOOL-0064 will often use ElleKit to alter the behavior of an app by modifying function arguments, return values of implementations, as described in @MASTG-TECH-0067.
