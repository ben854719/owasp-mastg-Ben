[Sileo](https://getsileo.app) is a third-party app store available for both rooted and rootless jailbreaks on iOS 12+. It provides a graphical user interface around `apt/dpkg` and allows you to install apps, binaries and tweaks. Sileo is packaged with popular jailbreaks such as Dopamine and palera1n.

!!! Warning "Installing apps"

    Installing applications via Sileo or any other third-party app store entails risks, as the applications are not validated by Apple. Be careful with installing unknown applications.

Many tools on a jailbroken device can be installed by using Sileo. By default, Sileo will already have some package repositories configured. You can add new repositories by navigating to **Sources** -> **Edit**, then clicking **Add** in the top left.

Some useful tools that can be installed this way:

- @MASTG-TOOL-0137
